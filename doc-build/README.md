# Jekyll Doc Theme

Go to [the website](https://aksakalli.github.io/jekyll-doc-theme/) for detailed information and demo.

## Running locally

You need Ruby and gem before starting, then:

```bash
# install bundler
gem install bundler

# clone the project
git clone https://github.com/aksakalli/jekyll-doc-theme.git
cd jekyll-doc-theme

# run jekyll with dependencies
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

## Docker

Alternatively, you can deploy it using the multi-stage [Dockerfile](Dockerfile)
that serves files from Nginx for better performance in production.

Build the image for your site's `JEKYLL_BASEURL`:

```
docker build --build-arg JEKYLL_BASEURL="/your-base/url" -t jekyll-doc-theme .
```

(or leave it empty for root: `JEKYLL_BASEURL=""`) and serve it:

```
docker run -p 8080:80 jekyll-doc-theme
```

## Getting started

[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) can automatically generate and serve the website for you.
Let's say you have a username/organisation `my-org` and project `my-proj`; if you locate Jekyll source under `docs` folder of master branch in your repo `github.com/my-org/my-proj`, the website will be served on `my-org.github.io/my-proj`.
The good thing about coupling your documentation with the source repo is, whenever you merge features with regarding content to master branch, it will also be published on the webpage instantly.

1. Just [download the source](https://github.com/aksakalli/jekyll-doc-theme/archive/gh-pages.zip) into your repo under `docs` folder.
2. Edit site settings in  `_config.yml` file according to your project. !!! `baseurl` should be your website's relative URI like `/my-proj` !!!
3. Replace `favicon.ico` and `img/logonav.png` with your own logo.

## Writing content

### Docs

Docs are [collections](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/collections/) of pages stored under `_docs` folder. To create a new page:

**1.** Create a new Markdown as `_docs/my-page.md` and write [front matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/) & content such as:

```
---
title: My Page
permalink: /docs/my-page/
---

Hello World!
```

**2.** Add the pagename to `_data/docs.yml` file in order to list in docs navigation panel:

```
- title: My Group Title
  docs:
  - my-page
```

### Blog posts

Add a new Markdown file such as `2017-05-09-my-post.md` and write the content similar to other post examples.

Note : it's removed from the top menu for the moment.

### Pages

The homepage is located under `index.html` file. You can change the content or design completely different welcome page for your taste. (You can use [bootstrap components](http://getbootstrap.com/components/))

In order to add a new page, create a new `.html` or `.md` (markdown) file under root directory and link it in `_includes/topnav.html`.
